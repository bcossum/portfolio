        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>I am a full stack developer currently living in Seattle. I attended classes at Coding Dojo where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JQuery and achieved a black belt (their highest achievement) in the Python language.

        Outside of coding I enjoy hiking, reading books and graphic novels, playing video games and board games, and watching movies. I find myself gravitating towards content that challenges me in some way, whether that be a game that has a high difficulty or something dealing with heavy or uinque subject matter or perhaps from a different cultural perspective. I do make time for the ligther fare, and have a rather large soft spot for Marvel Comics, X-Men in particular.</p>

            <h4>Board Game Tracker</h4>
            <p>A web application designed to help users track board game plays. Users can create accounts, curate their own favorite games, and add plays for any number of board games. I made use of boardgamegeek.com's API to pull from their database rather than relying on the user to create entries for the games they wished to log plays for. Eventually I will be adding in the ability to add other users as friends allowing you to view each other's recent plays.

            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Challenges:</span> Working with Board Game Geek's API was a considerable challenge. Their api is in XML, so I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to even read it myself before I was able to get my code to parse the XML. Beyond that it was simply drafting a database to house the plays. I used MySQL Workbench to help me visualize all the connections before creating, which made the database creation a breeze.</p>

            <h4>Metroidvania Video Game</h4>
            <p>This was a project I did with three other developers. We used the pygame library to create a short video game. I was project lead and after creating a storyboard with Balsamiq and setting up the project I was in charge of the player character logic and collision detection. The player character is able to shoot in eight directions and I also created a run animation from a gif animation that I turned into a sprite sheet.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Challenges:</span> The trick I found with game design was knowing where in the never ending loop that is the game to write your code. We tried very hard to keep our code organized and our method naming conventions make sense as to when the code written within would run be it at game start, game end, every game loop, or even only every couple of game loops.</p>
